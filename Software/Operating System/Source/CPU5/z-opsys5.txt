- All names starting with `>` were created by me.
- All names starting with '@', a letter, and a hex address were created by the
  disassembler.
- All other names are the original Centurion names, gleaned from a number of
  sources on the platter.

- OSNZ is the bootstrap code and extends far beyond 0x2FB1, which is where the
  first user program is loaded. This is because after it runs it is no longer
  needed (other than a little bit of it at the beginning to hold the bad-sector
  table), so it effectively releases that memory back for other use. They put a
  lot of effort in to reducing the memory footprint of OPSYS (at least
  pre-OPSYS6).
- As such, OSNZ must be linked last, and the OSNLB libraries are designed so
  that will happen automatically.
- There are a few functions after OSNZ, but they are only used by OSNZ so
  they can also be overwritten by user applications...
- Though TX004 and TX005 are demand-loaded by applications when they need
  them. OSNZ just borrowed them for their functionality needed during boot (like
  dealing with the system date).

- All of the code before OSN1 is the "sysgen" code that defines how you want
  the system configured. The procedure to create a different configuration is to
  modify that code, assemble it, and then link to OSNLB to actually pull in the
  OS code the sysgen refers to.

- The sector size is not at all hard-coded in OPSYS5 (or even OPSYS3). It is a
  sysgen setting.
- I suspect they tried other sector sizes and possibly ran in to reliability
  issues. Even if they stuck with 400 for compatibility between CPU-4 and -5
  (OPSYS3/5), the move to CPU-6 and OPSYS6 with an all-new filesystem would have
  let them switch to 512 byte sectors and they didn't even though the OPSYS
  itself was fully prepared to switch.
- Is it possible that pre-erase heads with their shortcut of erasing and
  writing at the same wouldn't work well without the longer data
  lengths/preambles/whatever?
- Ken has mentioned that the drive would occasionally read the wrong sector or
  something like that.
