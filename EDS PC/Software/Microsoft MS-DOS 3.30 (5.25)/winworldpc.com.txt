WinWorld is a site devoted to saving and sharing historic software -- 
providing free, unrestricted access to a large collection of vintage 
operating systems and applications. We believe old software that has 
fallen out of use should be available for anyone to use for the purposes 
of learning and experimentation.

Our downloads library can be accessed from our website

Stop by WinBoards, our small but long-standing community. Whether you're 
looking for help or just dropping by to say hello!
